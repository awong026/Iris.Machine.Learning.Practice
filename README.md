# Iris.Machine.Learning.Practice

## Objective
Follow a tutorial to practice machine learning in R

## Summary
Learned how to create a train and test set, learned how to create a 10 fold cross valiation setup, learned how to create 5 different models all at one time, (1. Linear Discrminant Analysis (LDA), 2. Classification and Regression Trees (CART), 3. k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a lienar kernel, 5. RAndom Forest(RF)), and learned how to check accuracy of models using dotplot
